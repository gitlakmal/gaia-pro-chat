Gaia Pro Chat - Intelligent Local AI Interface

Gaia Pro Chat is a robust, production-ready frontend application designed to interact with locally running Large Language Models (specifically optimized for Gaia/Qwen 2.5). Unlike standard chat interfaces, this project focuses on document processing and efficient data management without relying on external cloud services.

Key Capabilities:

📄 Advanced File Processing: Seamlessly upload and analyze PDF documents (using pdfjs-dist) and code files (.js, .py, .ts, etc.) directly within the chat.

💾 Smart Session Management: Features a sophisticated local storage system that maintains chat history, enforcing a 50-session limit with auto-deletion of the oldest records to optimize performance.

📥 Data Portability: Users can download individual chat sessions as .txt files for offline reference.

⚡ Modern Tech Stack: Built with React (TypeScript) and Vite for lightning-fast performance, styled with a responsive Dark Mode UI.
